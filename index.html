            <h3>Honolulu is Hawaii's main gateway to the world</h3>
            <p>
              The unique profile of Diamond Head sits prominently near the
              eastern edge of Waikiki's coastline. Hawaii's most recognized
              landmark is known for its historic hiking trail, stunning coastal
              view, and military history. Diamond Head State Monument
              encompasses over 475 acres, including the interior and outer
              slopes of the crater.
            </p>
            <p>
              This broad, saucer-shaped crater was formed about 300,000 years
              ago during a single, explosive eruption that sent ash and fine
              particles in the air. As these materials settled, they cemented
              together into a rock called tuff, creating the crater, and which
              is visible from the trail in the park. The trail to the summit was
              built in 1908 as part of O'ahu's coastal defense system.
