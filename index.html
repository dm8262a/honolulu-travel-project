            <h2>Why Honolulu?</h2>
            <h3>Honolulu is Hawaii's main gateway to the world</h3>
            <p>
              Sometimes called “The Gathering Place,” Oʻahu certainly lives up
              to its name. The third largest Hawaiian island is home to the
              majority of Hawaiʻi’s diverse population, a fusion of East and
              West cultures rooted in the values and traditions of the Native
              Hawaiian people. It’s this fundamental contrast between the
              ancient and the modern that makes discovering Oʻahu — from
              bustling city life to laidback surf towns — so enjoyable. You'll
              find plenty of different options for exploring Oʻahu's different
              regions, the island's many activities, its eclectic restaurants
              and accommodations.
            </p>
            <p>
              If Oʻahu is the heart of Hawaiʻi, then Honolulu is its racing
              pulse. In this cosmopolitan capital city, you’ll find everything
              from historic landmarks to fine dining to world-class shopping.
              Home to the majority of Oʻahu’s population, Honolulu stretches
              across the southeastern shores of the island, from Pearl Harbor to
              Makapuʻu Point, encompassing world-famous Waikīkī Beach along the
              way.
